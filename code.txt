%The program requires an image as input in the form of a rgb image and performing further conversions to get the final output. 
%Reading image
rgb = imread('F:\Development\MATLAB Codes\ImgProcBrainTumour\Images\img1.jpg');  


%The image imported to the program using the previous method is now converted to Gray Scale image.
%Converting to Gray Scale 
gray = rgb2gray(rgb);                                                                                           

%Generating standard inputs for the High Pass filter.
kernel1 = -1 * ones(3)/9;
kernel1(2,2) = 8/9

%Applying High Pass Filter
high_fil = imfilter(single(gray), kernel1);                                       

%The image, after passing through the high pass filter is free from the high frequency noise signals.
%Applying Median Filter to the gray scale image
med_fil = medfilt2(high_fil);                                                     
                                                                           
%The above steps enhances the quality of the image which helps in getting a clearer picture of the processed image.                                                                         

%The below steps help in finding the threshold for input image                                                                           
thresh = graythresh(med_fil) 

%The below step segments the image using threshold segmentation                                                   
bin= imbinarize(med_fil,thresh)                                                  

%Watershed Segmentation procedure
water = watershed(bin);
Lrgb = label2rgb(water);                                                       

%Presents the final output image.
